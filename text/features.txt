===Balance Chart===
Shows balance of (savings + checking) over time.

TODO:
- Subtract current credit card charges from the balance.
    
===Modify Charges Page===
Have page to modify transactions. On that page is a button to delete all. Data
is retrieved from the db. New categorized charges are added to the db.

TODO:
- Remove the txn from the table once it's been typed.


===Database Work====
- When should we store data?
Better plan: When we read the list of transactions, add all transactions unless
they already exist. Then "Modify Charges" will read from the db.

- Optimization on that would be to read the data from db store into memory on
first load. Use that instead of reading from db on every page load.

- "Store" needs to not overwrite data. Otherwise we'll lose the txn_type.
