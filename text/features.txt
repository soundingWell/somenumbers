Things to do 

There are 2 broad categories:
Charges and Balance. 

1) Implement Balance fully.
With balance we want to combine (savings + checking - charges since last payment)
    a. Implement a date to int function so we can see most recent.
    
DONEEEEEEEEEE


2) Implement txn_types Fully.

    a. Need classifications for rent / cable / car_insurance as subclass

3) Change "classification" to something shorter.

DONEEEEEEEEEEE

changed to txn_type

4) Have page to modify entries. On that page is a button to delete all.
This page will have a table like expenses, but only list the entries already
in the db.

5) On expenses/ remove the txn from the table once it's been typed.
